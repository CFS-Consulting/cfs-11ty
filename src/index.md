    title: Yoga Facilitation
    summary: The body is the site of our lived experiences, of oppression and privilege, of trauma and healing, of growth and self-affirmation.
    text: <p>The body is the site of our lived experiences, of oppression and privilege, of trauma and healing, of growth and self-affirmation.</p><p>Since 2002, my mat has often been the safest place I had, where I could be fully myself. I began teaching (RYT-200, Yogaworks NYC) in 2011. I strive to support moving bodies and facilitate each student’s unique capabilities and growth goals. I’ve taught in studios, gyms, community centers, places of worship, and in private homes.</p><p>As of Fall 2022, I will be training as a TCTSY-F (Trauma Center Trauma-Sensitive Yoga facilitator) through the <a href="https://www.traumasensitiveyoga.com/" target="_blank">Center for Trauma and Embodiment</a>. I incorporate the core principles (invitational language, choice-making, non-coercion interoception, & shared authentic experience) into both my regular teaching and into designated trauma-informed classes.</p><h3 class="text-3xl">testimonial</h3><p class="blockquote">“Caitlyn is an intuitive, compassionate yoga teacher, with a helpful balance of sensitivity and insistence, gentleness and drive. She takes the time to understand each of her student’s needs and abilities and adapts everything from a single pose to an entire series of classes for each student’s level. I have been in the same class with experienced yogis and first-timers; she makes us all feel welcome, challenged, and at peace with our practice.”<br><br>— Heather</p>

    title: Theater Work
    summary: As an individual and collaborative artist I work to level hierarchies and bring to light moments of tension that hold the possibility for change and growth.
    text: <p>As an individual and collaborative artist I work to level hierarchies and bring to light moments of tension that hold the possibility for change and growth. I use a combination of movement techniques guided by the Six Viewpoints (Mary Overlie) and interrogative game-play organized (Boal) to foster shared meaning-making with an audience.</p><p>I am a cofounder of Icara (2014), a women’s ensemble committed to creating original theater, through long-distance, process-oriented collaboration. We confront injustice by telling women's stories wherever we find them. Along with cofounder Napthali Fields-Forbes,  Icara cultivates brave spaces for female-identified, non-binary, and gender-queer artists.</p>

    title: Faith Spaces
    summary: I currently serve as the lay officiant for the monthly Compline service at St. John’s Cathedral (Los Angeles).
    text: <p>I currently serve as the lay officiant for the <a href="https://www.stjohnsla.org/" target="_blank">monthly Compline service</a> at St. John’s Cathedral (Los Angeles). Join us for this 30 minute candlelit service led by the Schola Cantorum.</p><p>As a person of faith it is important to me to co-create worship spaces that can address and make room for the healing of spiritual/religious trauma. I believe that the Christian tradition has historically been both an agent and opponent of white supremacy, Christian nationalism, and transnational capitalism. I firmly believe that the church is most useful and beautiful when, following our saints, we add our voices to the many that call for global liberation and healing.</p>

    Hello! I'm Cait (she/her). I'm a yoga facilitator, nonprofit leader, theater artist, and a believer in our communal capacity to imagine and bring about a better world. In all I do, I try to make and hold spaces for people to flourish.
