## {{ title | lower }}

I’ve spent most of my career working in nonprofit development, operations, and events. I love working with small nonprofits to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of your mission achievement.

Contact me to discuss:

- Evaluations of current practices
- Establishing and refining your web presence
- Building an effective communications strategy and mailing list
- Using free tools to define a donor pipeline
- Final editing and review of grant applications and reports

A typical consulting partnership will include:

- A free initial call to determine the scope of work and timeline
- Weekly check-ins and select deep dive co-working sessions
- Final meeting for a presentation of work and shared reflection time
