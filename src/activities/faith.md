## faith spaces

I currently serve as the lay officiant for the [monthly Compline service](https://www.stjohnsla.org/) at St. John’s Cathedral (Los Angeles). Join us for this 30 minute candlelit service led by the Schola Cantorum.

As a person of faith it is important to me to co-create worship spaces that can address and make room for the healing of spiritual/religious trauma. I believe that the Christian tradition has historically been both an agent and opponent of white supremacy, Christian nationalism, and transnational capitalism. I firmly believe that the church is most useful and beautiful when, following our saints, we add our voices to the many that call for global liberation and healing.
