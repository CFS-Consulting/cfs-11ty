## moving dialogue

### For Groups

I use a combination of movement techniques guided by the Six Viewpoints (Mary Overlie & Anne Bogart) and interrogative game-play (Augusto Boal) to foster shared meaning-making with your group. The anti-hierarchical knowledge from Viewpoints and physical insights from Boal help us all to listen for the unheard and find new narratives together. Moving Dialogue does not require any experience with body-based practices and can be created with people of all abilities.
