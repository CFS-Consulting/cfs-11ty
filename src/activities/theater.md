## tctsy facilitation

### For Individuals and Groups

In 2023, I was certified as a RYT-500 TCTSY-F (Trauma Center Trauma-Sensitive Yoga Facilitator) through the [Center for Trauma and Embodiment](https://jri.org/services/behavioral-health-and-trauma/center-for-trauma-and-embodiment). I incorporate the core principles (invitational language, choice-making, non-coercion, interoception, & shared authentic experience) into both my regular teaching and into designated trauma-sensitive classes.

I often support folks navigating religious trauma and/or spiritual abuse and I love working with people who are new to body-based practices. I provide a reliable support for whatever lifework you find yourself in.

I offer two 8-week closed practice groups each year in addition to private one to one facilitation. Contact me to learn more, or to begin a new practice group with your community.
