## {{ title | lower }}

As an individual and collaborative artist I work to level hierarchies and bring to light moments of tension that hold the possibility for change and growth. I use a combination of movement techniques guided by the Six Viewpoints (Mary Overlie) and interrogative game-play organized (Boal) to foster shared meaning-making with an audience.

I am a cofounder of Icara (2014), a womenâ€™s ensemble committed to creating original theater, through long-distance, process-oriented collaboration. We confront injustice by telling women's stories wherever we find them. Along with cofounder Napthali Fields-Forbes, Icara cultivates brave spaces for female-identified, non-binary, and gender-queer artists.
