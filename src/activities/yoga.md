The body is the site of our lived experiences, of oppression and privilege, of trauma and healing, of growth and self-affirmation.

Since 2002, my mat has often been the safest place I had, where I could be fully myself. I began teaching (RYT-200, Yogaworks NYC) in 2011. I strive to support moving bodies and facilitate each student’s unique capabilities and growth goals. I’ve taught in studios, gyms, community centers, places of worship, and in private homes.

As of Fall 2022, I will be training as a TCTSY-F (Trauma Center Trauma-Sensitive Yoga facilitator) through the [Center for Trauma and Embodiment](https://www.traumasensitiveyoga.com/). I incorporate the core principles (invitational language, choice-making, non-coercion interoception, & shared authentic experience) into both my regular teaching and into designated trauma-informed classes.

### testimonial

> “Caitlyn is an intuitive, compassionate yoga teacher, with a helpful balance of sensitivity and insistence, gentleness and drive. She takes the time to understand each of her student’s needs and abilities and adapts everything from a single pose to an entire series of classes for each student’s level. I have been in the same class with experienced yogis and first-timers; she makes us all feel welcome, challenged, and at peace with our practice.”<br><br>
