## yoga

### for individuals and groups

Since 2002, my mat has often been the safest place I had, where I could be fully myself. I began teaching (RYT-200, Yogaworks NYC) in 2011. In my yoga sessions I focus on building attunement with your own body to support each student’s unique capabilities and growth goals. I’ve taught in studios, gyms, community centers, places of worship, and in private homes.

### testimonial

> “Caitlyn is an intuitive, compassionate yoga teacher, with a helpful balance of sensitivity and insistence, gentleness and drive. She takes the time to understand each of her student’s needs and abilities and adapts everything from a single pose to an entire series of classes for each student’s level. I have been in the same class with experienced yogis and first-timers; she makes us all feel welcome, challenged, and at peace with our practice.”<br><br>
