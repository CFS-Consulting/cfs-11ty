## {{ title }}

Hello! I'm Cait (she/her). I'm a yoga facilitator, nonprofit leader, theater artist, and a believer in our communal capacity to imagine and bring about a better world. In all I do, I try to make and hold spaces for people to flourish.

I am currently discerning a call to ministry in the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. I live and work in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, which occupies the unceded lands of the Kizh Gabriele√±o and Gabrielino-Tongva peoples.
