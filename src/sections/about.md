Hi, I'm Cait. I am a 500-hr RYT with a 300-hr certification in TCTSY (Trauma Center Trauma Sensitive Yoga). I’m also a former movement artist, having trained in a variety of movement systems and dance forms. Yoga has been a life-long practice and an integral part of my own growth and healing journey. 

I'm a believer in our communal capacity to imagine and bring about a more compassionate world for ourselves and others. I often support folks navigating religious trauma and/or spiritual abuse and I love working with people who are new to body-based practices, providing a reliable support for your particular life's journey.

I live and work in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, which occupies the unceded lands of the Kizh Gabrieleño and Gabrielino-Tongva peoples. I work in-person and virtually at this time.
