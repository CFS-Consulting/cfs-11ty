## {{ title }}

Hi, I'm Cait. I'm a TCTSY facilitator, RYT-500, community storyteller, and survivor of a high-control religious group. In all I do, I try to make and hold spaces for people to flourish.

I live and work in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, which occupies the unceded lands of the Kizh Gabriele√±o and Gabrielino-Tongva peoples. I work in-person and virtually at this time.
